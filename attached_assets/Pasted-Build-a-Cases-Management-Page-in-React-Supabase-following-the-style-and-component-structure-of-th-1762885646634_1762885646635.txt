Build a Cases Management Page in React + Supabase, following the style and component structure of the DutchThrift Hub app.
The goal is to create a stable and clean drag-and-drop board for managing customer cases linked to orders or returns.

🧩 Core requirements

Page name: Cases
Purpose: Manage all cases related to orders, claims, or issues in progress.

🧱 Structure

The page should contain 4 main columns:

Nieuw (New)

In Behandeling (In Progress)

Wachtend op Klant (Waiting on Customer)

Opgelost (Resolved)

Each column displays the cases that belong to that status.
Cases can be dragged and dropped between columns — updating their status in Supabase immediately.
Use a smooth and reliable drag-and-drop library such as @dnd-kit or react-beautiful-dnd.

🧾 Case Data Model

Use this database structure in Supabase:

{
  id: string,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent',
  status: 'new' | 'in_progress' | 'waiting_customer' | 'resolved',
  linked_order_id?: string,
  linked_return_id?: string,
  customer_email?: string,
  sla_deadline?: Date,
  created_at: Date,
  updated_at: Date
}

🧠 Integrations

Universal Notes System

Integrate the existing universal notes system already used in the project.

Each case can display its related notes via the shared notes component (linked_type: 'case' and linked_id: case.id).

Linked Orders & Returns

Each case can be linked to an order or a return.

Display a clickable reference (like “View Order #1234”) on the case card.

Realtime Updates

Use Supabase on('INSERT'), on('UPDATE'), and on('DELETE') to keep the board live-updating.

🎨 UI / UX Requirements

Main layout:

Top summary widgets (Total Active, New Today, Resolved, Overdue SLA)

Search and filter bar

Four columns with draggable cards

Case card design:

Title

Description (shortened)

Priority badge (color-coded)

Linked order/return info

Notes count (📝)

SLA deadline (with red highlight if overdue)

Hover effect showing extra details (email, timestamps)

Modal: Create New Case
Fields:

Title

Description

Priority (dropdown)

Customer Email

SLA Deadline (optional)

Create button → saves to Supabase and adds to the “Nieuw” column.

🔧 Functional Logic

When a card is dropped into a new column → update its status in Supabase.

Use optimistic updates so the card moves instantly.

Allow case deletion and editing through context menu or modal.

Use consistent UI (buttons, modals, typography) with the rest of the DutchThrift Hub design.

Fully responsive layout (desktop + mobile).

🚀 Optional Enhancements

Add filters by priority or linked_order_id.

Add a “Show Archived” toggle to display resolved/closed cases.

Allow file uploads (attachments like images or PDFs) linked to a case.

Add notifications for SLA deadlines approaching.

✅ Goal

Deliver a clean, stable, and interactive Cases Management Page that:

Uses Supabase for data and realtime sync

Integrates seamlessly with the universal notes system

Allows easy linking with orders/returns

Has smooth drag-and-drop and a consistent UI across the Hub
