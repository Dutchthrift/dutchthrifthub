You are a senior UI/UX designer and frontend developer.
Refine and finalize the entire DutchThrift Hub web app design system for perfect visual consistency, responsiveness, and readability.

CONTEXT:
The UI design is modern and warm, but there are still issues:
- Inconsistent colors (some blue/purple tones remain)
- Unaligned headers, buttons, and inputs
- Sidebar text is hard to read due to low contrast and blur
- Some popups and panels are not mobile-optimized

GOAL:
Unify the entire design system visually and technically, keeping the current modern orange-accented look, while fixing contrast and responsiveness issues.

🎨 BRAND & STYLE DIRECTION:
- Primary: **Orange (#FF6600)** — accent only
- Background light: #F8F8F8  
- Background dark: #0E0E0E  
- Text colors:
  - Light mode: `#1C1C1C`
  - Dark mode: `#EDEDED`
  - Secondary text: `#B3B3B3`
- Typography: Inter / Outfit / Plus Jakarta Sans
- Design: rounded corners, soft shadows, glassmorphism, smooth transitions
- Avoid blue/purple hues entirely

🧩 COMPONENT & LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:

### 1. **Sidebar / Navigation Drawer**
- Fix text readability:
  - In dark/glass mode, increase contrast: use `text-gray-300` for inactive and `text-white` for active items.
  - Active menu (e.g., “Orders”) uses bright orange background (#FF6600) and white text.
  - Slight shadow behind active item for depth.
- Background: slightly darker translucent layer:
  - `background: rgba(20,20,20,0.55); backdrop-filter: blur(14px);`
- Ensure icons and text are aligned and visible.
- Equal spacing between all menu items and sections.
- On mobile:
  - Sidebar slides in smoothly with overlay
  - Closes when clicking outside or pressing “X”
  - Full-height overlay with blurred background
- Theme toggles (light/dark/system) grouped clearly at bottom

### 2. **Page Headers**
- Unified `<PageHeader />` component: title, subtitle, breadcrumbs, and actions
- Consistent padding, typography, and alignment across all pages

### 3. **Buttons**
- Unified `<Button />` variants: `primary`, `secondary`, `ghost`, `danger`
- Orange accent for primary, neutral tones for others
- Consistent height, radius, hover effects, and shadows

### 4. **Inputs, Filters, and Forms**
- Consistent radius, height, and border style
- Focus ring: `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-[#FF6600]`
- Vertical stacking on mobile, uniform padding and spacing
- Filter bar collapses responsively

### 5. **Popups & Modals**
- Use glassmorphism with strong contrast between text and background
- Blurred, semi-transparent surface (`backdrop-blur-xl`)
- Animated transitions (fade/scale)
- Full-screen modal or bottom drawer on mobile
- Consistent padding, borders, and spacing

### 6. **Layout & Alignment**
- Use one spacing system (Tailwind spacing scale)
- Consistent alignment for headers, buttons, and forms
- Unified margin rules and responsive grid

### 7. **Dark Mode**
- Deep gray backgrounds, soft light text
- Maintain strong text/background contrast
- Orange accents used sparingly and clearly visible
