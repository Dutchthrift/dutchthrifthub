Design and build a Repairs Management Page for an internal operations hub that tracks product repairs and returns for a webshop.
The goal is to manage, monitor, and document every repair from intake to completion — including technician assignments, issue tracking, and customer communication.

Use React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, following a modern dashboard style consistent with the rest of the hub.
