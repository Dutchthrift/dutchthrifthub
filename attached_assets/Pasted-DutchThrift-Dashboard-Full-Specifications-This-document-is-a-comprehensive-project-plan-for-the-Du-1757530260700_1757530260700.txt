DutchThrift Dashboard - Full Specifications
This document is a comprehensive project plan for the DutchThrift dashboard. It serves as a complete specification for its design and development, with a focus on user-friendliness, efficiency, and scalability.

1. Core Technologies & Integrations
The following technologies form the foundation of the DutchThrift dashboard.

Database: The entire platform is built on Supabase, serving as the primary backend and database for all application data, including user profiles, to-do lists, and repair statuses.

Order Management: All order data is sourced from and synchronized with Shopify, which acts as the single source of truth for all sales and customer information.

Email Sync: For email synchronization and inbox management, the platform uses the IMAP protocol to connect to mailboxes.

File Storage: Supabase is also used for secure file storage, including attachments and repair photos.

2. Global Elements (Everywhere)
Top Navigation: The navigation bar is intuitive and includes the following items: Home, Inbox, Orders, Repairs, To-do's, Dashboard, Search, Settings.

Search Bar: A global search bar that allows users to search by customer name, email, order number, and thread ID. The functionality saves recent searches and offers the ability to save complex search filters for future use.

Command Menu: A quick action menu that enables users to perform common tasks (create new to-do, start a repair, link to an order) with a simple keyboard shortcut.

Notification Center: Notifications for @mentions, new mail in open threads, and status changes. The system supports in-app notifications and optional browser push notifications.

User Menu: Provides access to profile settings, logout, and the ability to switch between a light and dark theme.

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): The view and actions on the platform are dependent on the user's role (Admin, Agent, Repair Tech, Viewer), which ensures a clean and relevant interface for each user.

Security: The platform requires a dedicated login screen for all users and enforces strict password rules and two-factor authentication (2FA).

3. Pages & Core Functionalities
3.0. Home Screen (Screen 1)
Goal: Provide a centralized, high-level overview of key data and a quick starting point for all users. This screen should be the first thing a user sees after logging in.

Widgets & Data Overview: The home screen will consist of a series of customizable widgets that display a snapshot of the most critical information, acting as a 'dashboard of dashboards.'

Personal To-do's: A clear list of the user's top 5 most urgent to-do's with their deadlines.

Inbox Status: A card showing the number of unread emails and threads that require a reply.

New Repairs: A visual count of new, unassigned repair requests.

SLA Alerts: A prominent widget that highlights any emails or tasks that are nearing or have missed their SLA deadline.

Team Activity Feed: A live feed of recent activity from the team, such as newly closed orders, completed repairs, or internal notes.

Quick Actions: The home screen will feature a row of prominent, easy-to-access buttons for the most common actions, such as "Start New Repair" or "Create a To-do."

3.1. Inbox
Goal: Centralized management of all incoming and outgoing emails.

List View: A clear list of threads with subject, customer, labels, last activity, unread indicator, and linked order/repair badges.

Filters & Bulk Actions: Users can filter by Open/Closed, Unanswered, With Attachment, Assigned to Me, and more. Bulk actions include marking, labeling, assigning, and closing threads.

Thread Detail: A detailed view of the full conversation, including an attachment viewer and internal notes. The Agent can use Reply and Forward directly from this view.

Side Panel: Displays contextual cards for the linked Order, the Customer Profile (including full history of interactions), and all linked items (to-do's, repairs).

Internal Collaboration: Internal notes support an @mention system, allowing an Agent to tag a colleague to delegate a task or ask a question.

Email Templates: A library of reusable email templates and canned responses is available for quickly answering frequently asked questions.

3.2. Orders
Goal: Quickly view order context and link it to communication.

View & Filters: A clear grid/list of orders with order number, customer, total, status, and tags. Filters are available for status, payment status, date, and customer.

Bulk Actions: The ability to tag orders, assign them, and export a CSV file.

Order Detail: A complete overview of basic data, items, payments, and the fulfillment timeline. Relationships with linked email threads, repairs, and to-do's are visible.

3.3. Repairs
Goal: Manage repair requests with a clear status flow.

View: A visual Kanban board with the following statuses: New, In Progress, Waiting for Customer/Part, Ready, and Closed.

Filters & Bulk Actions: Filters for status, priority, owner, and SLA. Bulk actions include status change, assignment, and priority.

Repair Detail: Detailed information such as the problem description, parts list, photos, and a timeline of all updates.

3.4. To-do's
Goal: Manage personal and team tasks, often linked to an email, order, or repair.

Views: List, Kanban, My Tasks, Team Tasks, and a Calendar for an overview of deadlines.

Quick Add: Fast addition via the Command Menu (⌘K) with automatic suggestions for linking to the current context.

Bulk Actions: The ability to assign tasks in bulk, prioritize them, and change their status or deadline.

3.5. Dashboard (KPIs)
Goal: Insight into team performance and workload.

Widgets: An overview of key metrics such as Open threads, First Response Time, Avg. resolution, Repairs per status, and SLA hits/misses.

Reports: Filters for period, team/agent, and channel with the option to create custom reports and export them to CSV or PDF.

4. Additional User-Centric Functionalities
Extended Customer Profile: A central overview of all interactions with a customer, including orders, repairs, emails, and notes, arranged chronologically.

Shortcuts: In addition to the Command Menu, there are extra keyboard shortcuts for frequently used actions, such as closing a ticket or assigning a task.

Responsiveness & Mobile View: The dashboard is fully responsive and adapts to any screen size (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Onboarding & Adoption: A brief, step-by-step introduction for new users to quickly familiarize them with the core functionalities.

Feedback & Bugs: An easy-to-find button in the UI that allows users to provide direct feedback or report bugs.

Gamification (optional): Future implementation of KPI leaderboards to provide insight into and encourage the performance of individual Agents or the team.

5. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
5.1. MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
The first version focuses on the core functionalities that provide immediate value:

Home Screen: A basic version of the home screen with key widgets.

Inbox + Thread Detail with the ability to link to an order and an extended customer profile.

Repairs: Creating a repair from an email + the Kanban view.

To-do's: A basic list with the ability to link to a source.

Simple Search Bar and Dashboard KPIs.

Settings for the Outlook and Shopify connections.

5.2. Next Steps & Future Scope
After a successful MVP launch, the functionality can be expanded in phases:

Phase 2: The full Orders page with all filters and bulk actions, and the complete Dashboard with all KPI widgets.

Phase 3: Implementation of advanced features such as Roles & Access, advanced Automations, email templates, and gamification.

Phase 4: Optimization of search functionality, international support, and optional development of a customer portal and API access.

6. Design & User Interface Principles
The final design of the dashboard should be hypermodern and fresh. All design decisions should prioritize a clean, intuitive, and efficient user experience.

Aesthetic Goal: Create a dashboard that is visually appealing and reduces cognitive load through a minimalist approach.

Color Palette: Use a carefully selected, modern color palette. The primary colors should be neutral (shades of grey, white, black) to ensure clarity, while a vibrant accent color draws attention to key actions and data points.

Typography: Select a clean, sans-serif font that is highly readable on all devices. Font weights should be used strategically to create a clear visual hierarchy.

Visual Style: The interface should feature plenty of white space. All cards and elements should have soft, rounded corners. Incorporate subtle shadows or gradients to create a sense of depth without clutter.

Iconography: Use a consistent, modern icon set (e.g., Lucide, Phosphor) that aligns with the overall minimalist aesthetic.

Animations & Transitions: Implement smooth, non-intrusive animations for state changes, hover effects, and page transitions. This provides a more fluid and responsive user experience.

Responsiveness: Ensure the design not only adapts its layout but also maintains its aesthetic quality and usability on mobile devices. Elements should scale and adapt elegantly.
