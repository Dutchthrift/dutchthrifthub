Redesign To-Do Page for an internal operations hub that manages all workflows for a webshop — including orders, cases, purchase orders, and daily tasks.

The goal is to create a central to-do system where the team can manage and track all ongoing work efficiently.
The page should be modern, clean, and built with React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui (matching a dashboard-style hub).

🧩 Core Features:

Task Dashboard / List View

Show: title, description (short), status (To Do / In Progress / Done), priority (Low / Normal / High), deadline, assigned user, created by.

Add sorting (by date, priority, status) and filtering (by status, user, category, or due date).

Inline quick actions (mark as done, edit, delete).

Task Details (Modal or Drawer)

When clicking a task, open a detailed view:

Full description

Comments / internal notes

Activity history (who changed what)

File attachments or related links (e.g., order ID, case ID)

Create New Task Form

Fields: title, description, category (Orders / Purchasing / Marketing / Admin / Other), deadline, priority, assigned to, related entity (order ID, case ID, purchase ID).

Automatically log creation date and creator.

Multiple Layout Options

🟦 Kanban View (drag & drop between columns)

🔲 List View (table layout)

📅 Calendar View (show tasks by due date)

⚙️ Advanced Features:

Automatic task creation triggered by new orders or cases.

Recurring tasks (daily, weekly, monthly).

Subtasks / checklists per main task.

Mentions in comments (@username).

Integration with the order and case systems:

e.g. “Create task for this order” button on order pages.

📈 Analytics & Insights:

Summary cards showing:

Open tasks count

Tasks per user

Tasks by category

Average completion time

Notifications for:

Upcoming deadlines

Tasks assigned to the user

👤 User Roles:

Admin: full access

Support team-level view

Technicus: only own tasks

🎨 UI & UX Guidelines:

Use color coding:

Red = High Priority

Yellow = Normal

Green = Low

Include a floating “+ New Task” button.

Support quick search (keyboard shortcuts like /search or N for new task).

Responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile.
