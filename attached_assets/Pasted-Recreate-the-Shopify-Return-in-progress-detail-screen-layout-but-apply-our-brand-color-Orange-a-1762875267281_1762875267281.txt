Recreate the Shopify “Return in progress” detail screen layout, but apply our brand color = Orange as the primary accent. Keep information architecture and UX patterns—plus a robust Notes system (see below).

Brand & Theming

Add theme tokens (CSS variables or TS constants):

--brand-orange-600: #F59E0B (primary)

--brand-orange-700: #D97706

--brand-orange-100: #FEF3C7
Use neutrals from Tailwind slate/gray.
Orange is used for primary buttons, focus rings, active status chip, banners.

Page Structure

Header bar

Left: #8915 (return reference).

Status chips: Paid, Fulfilled, Return in progress.

Subtext: “10 November 2025 at 12:16 from Online Store”.

Right button group: Refund, Edit, Print, More actions ▾.

Main content grid (desktop: 2 columns)

Left column

Card: Return in progress

Header: icon + title; small reference (e.g., #8915-R1) on the right.

Tracking row with lock icon + carrier link.

Returned items list (thumbnail, title, SKU, reason, qty, price).

“Unreleased exchange items” section.

Right-aligned primary button Process return (orange).

Card: Payment / Balance

“Paid” chip.

Light brand banner: “A return is in progress and the order balance may change once processed.”

Totals table (Subtotal, Items, Total).

Right column (~360px)

Notes (Advanced) ← see next section.

Customer

Name (link), orders count, email (link), phone.

Shipping address + “View map”.

Billing address (or “Same as shipping address”).

Status System (chips + banner)

Badge variants:

return_in_progress → brand orange (solid for banner, soft for chip).

paid, fulfilled → gray.

Keep variants for future: received_control (orange-soft), approved_refund (green), missing_package (red), waiting_customer (yellow), reship (purple), closed_not_received (gray).

Advanced Notes (replace the simple Notes card)

Purpose: Centralize communication, decisions, and evidence for each return. Notes must be fast, structured, and auditable.

Features

Note types: internal (visible only to staff), customer_visible (can be shared), system (auto-generated).

Threading & replies: each note supports reply threads with indentation.

Mentions & notify: @teammate autocomplete; optional email/push notify toggle.

Pins: pin critical notes to top; max 3 pins; show pin count.

Tags: freeform chips (e.g., refund, verification, photo, gls).

Attachments: image/PDF upload preview; drag-and-drop; file size limit feedback.

Quick templates: dropdown with canned snippets (e.g., “RMA instructions”, “Refund approved”); insert variables like {orderId}, {customerFirstName}.

Smart links: auto-link order IDs, tracking codes, SKUs.

Status-linked prompts: when status = waiting_customer or missing_package, show contextual templates on composer.

Timeline & audit: each note shows author, timestamp, edited badge; hover reveals change log.

Edit & delete (with reasons): editing preserves history; deleting requires a reason (kept in audit).

Reactions: 👍 👀 ✅ (lightweight acknowledgment).

Follow-ups: add due date + assignee; shows in a small “Tasks” sublist; overdue turns orange.

Filters & search: by type, tag, author, has:attachment, date range; full-text search.

Visibility switch: composer toggle “Internal / Share with customer”.

Export: export filtered notes to Markdown; exclude internal by default.

Email sync (stub): surface a “Linked emails” area (list inbound/outbound message subjects) and allow creating a note from an email (for later integration).

Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Enter to post, / to open templates, @ to mention, # to add tag.

Notes UI

Header: “Notes” + counts: All, Internal, Customer + filter button + search field.

Pinned notes section (if any).

Composer:

Rich text (bold/italic/links, bullet list).

Visibility toggle pill.

Attachment zone with previews.

Template button.

Primary submit (orange), secondary cancel.

Note card:

Avatar, name, timestamp (relative + tooltip absolute).

Internal: slate/neutral

Customer: orange outline

System: indigo soft

Body with linkified entities + attachments grid.

Footer actions: Reply, Pin/Unpin, Edit, Delete, Add follow-up, reactions.

Thread replies collapsed after 2; “Show more replies”.

ARIA labels for composer controls.

Announce posting, edit, delete via status region.

Components

Create reusable components under src/components:

PageHeader.tsx

StatusChip.tsx

Card.tsx (with CardHeader, CardBody, CardFooter)

InfoBanner.tsx

ItemRow.tsx

KeyValue.tsx

Notes/

NotesPanel.tsx (container with filters/search)

NoteComposer.tsx

NoteItem.tsx

NoteThread.tsx

NoteFilters.tsx

AttachmentPreview.tsx

NoteExportButton.tsx

Types (no mock data; types only)

Create src/types/notes.ts:

export type NoteVisibility = "internal" | "customer_visible" | "system";

export interface NoteAttachment {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  mime: string;
  sizeBytes: number;
  url?: string;         // optional until uploaded
  previewUrl?: string;  // image thumbs
  createdAt: string;
}

export interface NoteReaction {
  emoji: "👍" | "👀" | "✅";
  userId: string;
}

export interface NoteFollowUp {
  id: string;
  dueAt: string;
  assigneeId: string;
  completedAt?: string;
}

export interface Note {
  id: string;
  authorId: string;
  authorName: string;
  visibility: NoteVisibility;
  tags: string[];
  contentHtml: string;     // sanitized
  attachments?: NoteAttachment[];
  reactions?: NoteReaction[];
  followUps?: NoteFollowUp[];
  pinned?: boolean;
  parentId?: string;       // for threading
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt?: string;
  deletedAt?: string;
  deleteReason?: string;
  source?: "manual" | "email" | "system";
}


Create src/types/return.ts with minimal contracts needed by the page (ids, strings, totals), but do not include any concrete mock objects.

Interactions (stub handlers only)

onProcessReturn(returnId)

Notes:

onCreateNote(noteDraft)

onUpdateNote(noteId, patch)

onDeleteNote(noteId, reason)

onTogglePin(noteId)

onAddReaction(noteId, emoji)

onAddFollowUp(noteId, followUp)

onUploadAttachment(file) → returns {id, previewUrl}

onExportNotes(filter) → downloads .md
All handlers may console.log for now.

Acceptance Criteria

Visual hierarchy matches Shopify’s layout; orange is the primary accent.

Desktop two-column; mobile stacks.

Notes panel supports: types, replies, pins, tags, attachments, templates, search, filters, reactions, follow-ups, export, and audit badges (edited/deleted).

Keyboard accessible (composer + actions); orange focus states.

No mock data included; components accept props and render without runtime TS errors.
